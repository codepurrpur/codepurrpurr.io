I'm a solutions engineer specializing in authentication and cloud engineering. I turn complex systems into secure, practical solutions—whether it's identity workflows or cloud infrastructure.

This site is a technical journal and the start of my consulting practice. I work where clarity matters, security is critical, and overengineering isn't welcome.

Need help with cloud architecture or authentication? Let’s talk.
